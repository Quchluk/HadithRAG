HadithRAG

HadithRAG is an open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to enable semantic question answering over large-scale hadith corpora. By leveraging vector-based search with ChromaDB and modern language models, it provides researchers, students, and developers with efficient access to classical Islamic texts.

This project is intended to support digital research in Islamic studies, combining computational linguistics and scalable text retrieval to process thousands of narrations across canonical collections.

‚ö†Ô∏è The project is under active development. Core components are operational, but the interface and retrieval pipeline are being continuously improved.

## üìö Hadith Corpus

This project is built upon one of the most comprehensive open-access datasets in the field of Islamic studies: the [Open Hadith Data](https://github.com/mhashim6/Open-Hadith-Data) collection curated by [Muhammad Hashim (mhashim6)](https://github.com/mhashim6). The dataset brings together over **50,000 authenticated hadiths** drawn from **nine classical collections**, including the **Kutub al-Sittah (The Six Canonical Books)**, which constitute the core of Sunni Islam‚Äôs hadith tradition.

These texts are foundational not only in Islamic theology (* øaqƒ´dah*) and jurisprudence (*fiqh*), but also in historical linguistics, ethics, and Islamic intellectual history. For centuries, they have served as a basis for scholarly discourse, legal reasoning (*ijtihƒÅd*), and social practice across the Muslim world. Their canonical status makes them a uniquely valuable subject of computational exploration.

### üìò Included Collections:

The dataset includes the following works, each provided in both **diacritized and undiacritized** Arabic, formatted for computational parsing:

- **Sahih al-Bukhari** (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿÆÿßÿ±Ÿä) ‚Äî *Imam al-Bukhari (d. 870 CE)*
- **Sahih Muslim** (ÿµÿ≠Ÿäÿ≠ ŸÖÿ≥ŸÑŸÖ) ‚Äî *Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj (d. 875 CE)*
- **Sunan Abu Dawud** (ÿ≥ŸèŸÜŸÜ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿØÿßŸàÿØ) ‚Äî *Abu Dawud al-Sijistani (d. 889 CE)*
- **Jami‚Äò al-Tirmidhi** (ÿ¨ÿßŸÖÿπ ÿßŸÑÿ™ÿ±ŸÖÿ∞Ÿä) ‚Äî *al-Tirmidhi (d. 892 CE)*
- **Sunan al-Nasa‚Äôi** (ÿßŸÑÿ≥ŸÜŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿµÿ∫ÿ±Ÿâ) ‚Äî *al-Nasa‚Äôi (d. 915 CE)*
- **Sunan Ibn Majah** (ÿ≥ŸèŸÜŸÜ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿßÿ¨Ÿá) ‚Äî *Ibn Majah (d. 887 CE)*
- **Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal** (ŸÖŸèÿ≥ŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ≠ŸÜÿ®ŸÑ) ‚Äî *Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 855 CE)*
- **Muwatta Malik** (ŸÖŸàÿ∑ÿ£ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßŸÖ ŸÖÿßŸÑŸÉ) ‚Äî *Malik ibn Anas (d. 795 CE)*
- **Sunan al-Darimi** (ÿ≥ŸèŸÜŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿØÿßÿ±ŸÖŸä) ‚Äî *al-Darimi (d. 869 CE)*

Each entry includes full metadata such as book name, chapter, section, hadith number, and narrator chain (*isnƒÅd*), allowing for granular access and semantic filtering.

### üóÉÔ∏è Integration into This Project

To optimize the corpus for high-performance machine learning and semantic retrieval tasks, all hadiths were **converted from CSV into a unified `.parquet` format**:  
**`hadith_corpus_extended.parquet`**

This conversion ensures:

- **Efficient vector indexing** (via ChromaDB or similar frameworks)
- **High-speed queries and filtering**
- **Compatibility with large-scale RAG pipelines**
- **Compact storage for 50k+ entries** in a single, load-efficient binary format

This dataset serves as the **semantic backbone** of the HadithRAG application, enabling both accurate question answering and scalable research workflows in the digital humanities and Islamic NLP.

> üß† HadithRAG represents one of the first practical RAG frameworks applied to a complete canonical hadith corpus, setting a foundation for future semantic reasoning systems in religious and historical textual domains.
